          When you click on this button, the report is uploaded to your GrepoData account.

          2. <strong>Browsing:</strong> Our service will analyse the report to extract enemy intelligence.
          The extracted enemy intel is linked to your GrepoData account.
          This allows you to browse the collected intel using the in-game town intel view or by logging in here.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          3. <strong>Sharing:</strong> If you are a member of a GrepoData team and if you enable contributions to that team, the report you just indexed will also be shared with your allies as long as they also have access to that team.

    <h2 class="gd-primary">Why do I need a GrepoData account?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      A GrepoData account is required to guarantee the security of the intel you collect and the people you share it with.
      This way, the admin of a team (formerly known as 'index') can manage exactly who has access to the intel and can revoke their access whenever needed.
      Simply having a URL to an index will no longer grant you access to the intel in that index.
      <br/>
      This is also one of the measures we had to take to pursue official approval of our userscript.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Privacy is very important to us. Your username is visible to all GrepoData users but your email address will always remain private and will only be used to authenticate you when you wish to reset your password.
      At any time, you are able to completely delete your account from our database. Read more in our <a routerLink="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.

    <h2 class="gd-primary">How do I delete my GrepoData account?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      You can delete your account and all associated data from our server by logging in to your account and navigating to the '<a routerLink="/profile/settings">My Account</a>' section.
      Here you can enter your password and submit a request to delete your account. Once you confirm the request by clicking on the link in the email you received, all your personal data will be permanently removed from our database.

    <h2 class="gd-primary">What is a team?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      An <strong>team</strong> is a collection of enemy intelligence. Anyone can create a new team and invite others to join their team.
      The members of a team can then choose to contribute the reports they collect to the team. All members of the team will also be able to browse this intel.
      <br/>
      Our recommendation is that you create a team together with your alliance. This way, you can work together to gather enemy intelligence.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Before April 2021, a team used to be known as an 'index'.</strong> Teams are the replacement of the old index system, but their functionality is still very similar.

    <h2 class="gd-primary">Is it allowed?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      Our script does not automate any gameplay elements, and therefore is in compliance with the overall rules.
      Each interaction with the city indexer tool requires a manual action by the user, which means you are unlikely to get a ban for using the tool.
      <br/>Official approval is still pending. <a href="https://en.forum.grepolis.com/index.php?threads/grepodata-enemy-city-indexer-pending-approval.62245/#post-1057206" target="_blank">You can find more info about this here.</a>

  <div class="alert alert-gd-1">
    <h2 class="gd-primary">What type of reports are collected?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      Currently our userscript allows you to collect published reports that are posted on your alliance forum or sent to you in a personal message.
      Reports from your reports inbox can also be indexed without publishing them.
      Converted reports from other third party tools can not yet be indexed.

    <h2 class="gd-primary">Is my team secure?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      As an admin or owner of a team, you can add or remove users from the team at any time. Only active members of the team will have access to the information in the team. Once you remove a user, they will nog longer be able to access the collected intel from your team.

  <div class="alert alert-gd-1">
    <h2 class="gd-primary">Who should install the userscript?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      The userscript is the only way to contribute new intel to a team collection. You should encourage your team members to also use the script in order to maximize the collected intel.

    <h2 class="gd-primary">How do i uninstall the userscript?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      If you want to uninstall the userscript, navigate to the Tampermonkey dashboard by left clicking on the <strong>Tampermonkey</strong> icon in the top right of your browser,
      and then clicking on <strong>Dashboard</strong>. Find the script called 'GrepoData City Indexer' in this list and remove it from Tampermonkey by clicking the trash can icon next to it.

      As of April 2021, a GrepoData account is required to collect and browse the intel. Sign up for an account to continue using our city indexer tool.
